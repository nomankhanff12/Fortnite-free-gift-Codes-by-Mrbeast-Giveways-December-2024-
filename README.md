Fortnite’s Glittering Goods
Fortnite, the ever-popular battle royale, continues to captivate millions with its dynamic gameplay, evolving storyline, and a treasure trove of customization options. While the core gameplay loop of “last man standing” remains thrilling, it’s undeniable that a major draw for many players is the vast array of cosmetics. Character skins, emotes, gliders, and harvesting tools – the possibilities to personalize your avatar and express yourself on the battlefield are seemingly endless.
